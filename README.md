# Udacity OAuth Coursework

This repo houses my notes and exercises for the 4 part Udacity course titled "Authentication and Authorization: OAuth".

## Me taking the course

I began this course in 2017, but took a break from it when I hit the FaceBook authentication section (since I do not have a FaceBook account and was able to follow along with the explanations well enough). I'm returning to complete the course in early 2018, partly so that I can justify adding it to my list of courses with all coursework completed.

## More about the course

The signup page for this course is at https://www.udacity.com/course/authentication-authorization-oauth--ud330. This is one of their many free courses. I've enjoyed it well enough, but two observations:
1. I read the OAuth 2.0 documentation, which I extremely highly recommend doing before or along with the course
2. The course was easy when I already understood an underlying concept, but hardly 100% clear when I did't

## Repo history

When I started this coursework last year, it lived inside of my older general Udacity course notes and exercises repo. In March 2018 I pulled the coursework out into this, its own repo.
